### Hello!

My name is Charise. I am a Full Stack Web Developer that is passionate about combining education, creativity and programming into one. I love to build websites and games.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m pllanning out my complete overhauling of my portfolio using React and getting better at designing the back-end.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m practicing becoming more proficient at Vanilla JavaScript to reinforce all I learned.
- ðŸ’¬ My plan is to move to Japan next. Being there will help my research for a future project I have planned.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the best places to stay or eat in South Korea.
